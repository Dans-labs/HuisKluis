						<h1>About the HuisKluis ("House safe")</h1>
					</div>
					<h2>What is it exactly ?</h2>
					<p>The government of the Netherlands has a lot of data about
						the citizens and basic infrastructure which are contained in
						so-called basic registers. Through an open data policy, the
						content of these registers is becoming available to the citizens
						but having the data open does not implies that it becomes
						accessible right away. Those willing to use that data have to go
						to different places to grab it and perform some data integration
						on their own.</p>
					<p>
						On the other hand, citizens have data that could be useful to the
						government, or city related services, and which is not available.
						Let us consider, for instance, the case of a fire in a home. The
						fire brigade in charge of dealing with the incident would make a
						great use of some detailed information about the house (<em>e.g.</em>
						the location of the valuables, the list of sleeping rooms, the
						presence of toxic materials) to better focus their efforts. This
						data is not open and should not be so to prevent its misuse, still
						it would be good to make it available within a given set of
						trusted parties
					</p>
					<p>The "HuisKluis" is a concept bringing both points of view
						together around a central application. Through this house-centric
						application, citizens can:
					<ul>
						<li>Get a single, harmonised, view over all the governmental
							data about the house</li>
						<li>Provide additional restricted information</li>
						<li>Control who gets access to the restricted information</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The implementation you are looking at right now is a first
						prototype of such a "HuisKluis" focusing on Dutch houses</p>
					<h2>What are the data sources ?</h2>
					<p>The application uses all sort of external open data sets in
						addition to its own internal restricted data set</p>
					<p>At the moment, the following open data sets are in use:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Linked Open Data export from <a
							href="http://netage.nl/en/">Netage.nl</a> of the <a
							href="http://bag.vrom.nl/">basic registry of addresses and
								building (BAG)</a></li>
						<li>The map data from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open
								Street Map</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Can I use/trust the HuisKluis data ?</h2>
					<p>
						In short, <strong>no !</strong>. We implemented a basic security
						system using e-mails as shared secret. Although the e-mail are
						obtained through an OAuth2 authentication with the services from
						Google+, they are used as non encrypted key with all communication
						with the restricted data source. In addition, the harmonised data
						generated for the application is using arbitrary vocabularies and
						is likely to change a lot during further developments.
					</p>
					<p>You are advised to directly use the same open data the
						HuisKluis uses, or use the data generated by the HuisKluis at your
						own risk</p>
					<h2>How does it work?</h2>
					<p>The HuisKluis is implemented as two different parts, a
						server and a client applications:</p>
					<p>Server: the server implements a RESTful API that collect
						data from various Open Data sources and combine them into an
						harmonised data set (in RDF) about a given house. This server is
						implemented in Java with the RestLet and Jena libraries, it runs
						on the AppEngine platform from Google</p>
					<p>
						Client: the client is a Web application wrote in
						HTML5/CSS3/Javascript using <a
							href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/index.html">Bootstrap</a>,
						<a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and <a
							href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>. The application is
						designed to work fine on any kind of Web-enabled device (desktop,
						phone, tablet, ...) running modern Web browsers
					</p>
					<p>
						The source code of both the server and client part are open source
						and <a href="https://github.com/cgueret/HuisKluis">available
							on GitHub</a>
					</p>
					<h2>Who is behind that ?</h2>
					<p>
						This application has been developed in the context of the <a
							href="http://www.geonovum.nl/dossiers/linkedopendata">Pilot
							Linked Open Data project</a> (see the <a
							href="http://www.geonovum.nl/dossiers/linkedopendata/deelnemers">list
							of participants</a>) with financial and R&amp;D support from the <a
							href="http://www.networkinstitute.org/">Network Institute</a> of
						the <a href="http://www.vu.nl/nl/index.asp">VU University of
							Amsterdam</a> along with <a href="http://www.dans.knaw.nl/">Data
							Archiving and Networking Services (DANS)</a>, an institute from the <a
							href="http://www.knaw.nl/">Royal Netherlands Academy of
							Sciences (KNAW)</a>.
